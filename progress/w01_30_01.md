### My lessons
<!-- What did I learn? -->
<u>Everything I learned</u>

- Basics of Angular
- Running an Angular project

<u>The key lesson(s) of this week:</u>

Observables are timelines. Values which change over time. Using Rxjs, a system can be developed to react to these timelines, hence the name "reactive programming."

### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was exciting because I was learning a new development framework while working on an actual project in collaboration with others.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more encouraged because I am getting more familiar with how Angular and Typescript work.

- I find the project to be  exciting and challenging at the same time.

- My level of stress is manageable.
