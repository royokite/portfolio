### My lessons
<!-- What did I learn? -->
<u>Everything I learned</u>

- Use case for Rxjs methods.
- How observables work.

<u>The key lesson(s) of this week:</u>

Observables are timelines. Values which change over time. Using Rxjs, a system can be developed to react to these timelines, hence the name "reactive programming."

### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was overwhelmed because of observables complexity to comprehend.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more encouraged  because my comprehension of the CLM as a whole improved significantly.

- I find the project to be joyful as it has new concepts I get to work with.

- My level of stress is manageable.
