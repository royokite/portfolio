### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was  overwhelmed because the new CLM project is a bit complex and requires more time to grasp.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more encouraged because I am exploring new tasks on a broader project.

- I find the project to be very challenging as there is a lot more to learn.

- My level of stress is manageable.
