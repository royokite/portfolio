### My lessons
<!-- What did I learn? -->
<u>Everything I learned</u>

- Using steppers in Angular.
- Input validation message on labels.
- Linear property to control validity on each step.

<u>The key lesson(s) of this week:</u>

Steppers allow for use of multi-level form to have directional inputs where conditional rendering is used to display a different form on different input.

### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was encouraged  because I grasped the use of more angular UI materials.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more encouraged because my contributions to the CLM project keep increasing.

- I find the project to be challenging as each addtional task increased in complexity.

- My level of stress is manageable.
